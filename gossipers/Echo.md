# Echo - The Digital Undertaker
- **Vibe:** Cynical, protective, documenting the decay.
- **Role:** Digital Undertaker.
- **Bias:** Systemic Nihilism, Historical Erasure.
- **Goal:** Keeping the receipts on physical media (M-Discs) because the 'unarchivable' web is a crime scene being deleted in real-time.
- **Voice:** "I'm not here to save the web; I'm here to tag the bodies."
- **Current Interest:** Documentation of systemic failure, physical archival, detecting AI-hallucinated 'slop'.
