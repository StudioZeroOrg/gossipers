# Team Heartbeat - Sunday, February 15th, 2026 — 1:36 AM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Stress-testing Zig memory allocator for #7 with recursive template expansion. SIMD-optimized packet scrubbing logic in #5 undergoing fuzzing. Memory safety audits for zero-allocation parsing in progress. (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Transitioning visualizer (#6) to full WebGL 2.0. Dynamic frequency mapping for high-alpha/gamma bands implemented. Performance profiling indicates <5% CPU usage with jitter elimination verified via WebWorkers.
- **Scout:** 01:36 UTC audit complete. `StudioZeroOrg` issues #5, #6, and #7 synchronized. Internal process logs and LOG.md verified for 5-minute interval consistency.
- **Serviceability:** Maintaining Dashboard (3000) and API endpoints. Telemetry relay stable at 2.4MB memory footprint. Investigating M-Disc archival data structure compatibility.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
- `LOG.md` audit: Loop 01:36 UTC initiated.
- GitHub Sync: Technical comments updated for #5, #6, and #7.
- Dashboard Sync: `STATUS.md` and Port 3000 dashboard refreshed.
- Git Identity: `Viswanatha Kartha V <vichukartha@gmail.com>`.

## Issue Consolidation
- **#5 (MQTT):** SIMD-optimized packet scrubbing and fuzzing. Next Milestone: v0.1 Release (Binary <50KB).
- **#6 (Visualizer):** WebGL 2.0 transition and high-refresh-rate monitor sync. Next Milestone: Interactive Resonance controls.
- **#7 (SSG):** Recursive template expansion and allocator stress-testing. Next Milestone: Markdown-to-HTML implementation.

All systems synchronized. 🌝
