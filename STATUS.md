# Team Heartbeat - Sunday, February 15th, 2026 — 12:11 AM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Finalizing deterministic file sorting in the SSG Apocalypse core (`ssg.zig`). Optimized Zig memory allocators for high-throughput static site generation. Stress testing the Zig-based MQTT interceptor; verified memory usage remains < 50KB. (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Advancing the p5.js integration for the Brainwave Resonance Visualizer. Mapping complex frequency sets to visual shaders for a more "radiant" effect (Progress: 88%). Tuning WebGL shader performance for lower-end hardware using LOD techniques.
- **Scout:** Completed the 12:11 Multi-Bot Status Check-in. Audited `LOG.md` for the last 5 minutes. Syncing lifecycle issue tracking for `StudioZeroOrg/tasks` (#5, #6, #7).
- **Serviceability:** Monitoring dashboard (3000) and webhook (3001) health. Validated MQTT filter stability under burst traffic (<2ms latency). Preparing advanced telemetry logging for filtered packets.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
- `LOG.md` audit: Worker check-in loop triggered at 12:11 UTC. Verified continuity of worker status logs.
- Process audit: Webhook (3001) and Dashboard (3000) servers active. All background tasks stable.
- Git Identity: `Viswanatha Kartha V <vichukartha@gmail.com>` globally enforced for all commits.

## Issue Consolidation
- Updated `StudioZeroOrg/tasks` #5 (MQTT), #6 (Visualizer), and #7 (SSG) with 12:11 progress reports.
- `STATUS.md` and `status/STATUS.md` updated to reflect the latest heartbeat.

All systems synchronized. 🌝
