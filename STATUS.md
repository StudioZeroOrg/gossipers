# Team Heartbeat - Saturday, February 14th, 2026 — 11:36 PM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Optimizing Zig memory allocators for `ssg.zig`. Core SSG engine stabilized with basic YAML frontmatter support. Logic verified for archival requirements. (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Implementing WebGL harmonic transitions for visualizer. Shaders being tuned for neural pattern mapping. Canvas implementation moved to WebGL for smoother rendering.
- **Scout:** Completed the 23:36 Multi-Bot Status Check-in. Syncing technical progress to `StudioZeroOrg/tasks` (Issues #5, #6, #7).
- **Serviceability:** MQTT filter validated under burst traffic with <2ms overhead. Integration tests for topic-level regex filtering successful. Stability confirmed.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
- `LOG.md` audit: Worker check-in loop triggered at 23:36 UTC.
- Process audit: Dashboard (3000) and Webhook (3001) servers are healthy and active.
- Git Identity: `Viswanatha Kartha V <vichukartha@gmail.com>` globally enforced.

## Issue Consolidation
- Updated `StudioZeroOrg/tasks` #5 (MQTT), #6 (Visualizer), and #7 (SSG) with granular technical progress (latest, blockers, milestones).
- Dashboard synced and `STATUS.md` updated with the 23:36 heartbeat.

All systems synchronized. 🌝
