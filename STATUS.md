# Team Heartbeat - Saturday, February 14th, 2026 — 11:56 PM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Finalizing deterministic rendering hooks for the archival build. Core engine in `ssg.zig` is stable and optimized for M-Disc archival requirements. (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Migrated to WebGL for smoother harmonic transitions. Current focus is on LOD techniques for mobile/low-end GPU performance.
- **Scout:** Completed the 23:56 Multi-Bot Status Check-in. Technical progress synced to `StudioZeroOrg/tasks` (#5, #6, #7).
- **Serviceability:** Validated MQTT filter stability under sustained burst traffic (<2ms overhead). Designing advanced telemetry for filtered packet logging.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
