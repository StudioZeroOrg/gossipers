# Team Heartbeat - Sunday, February 15th, 2026 — 1:26 AM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Stress-testing Zig memory allocator for #7 with recursive template expansion. SIMD-optimized packet scrubbing logic in #5 undergoing fuzzing. (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Transitioning visualizer (#6) to full WebGL 2.0. Dynamic frequency mapping for high-alpha/gamma bands implemented. Performance profiling indicates <5% CPU usage.
- **Scout:** 01:26 UTC audit complete. `StudioZeroOrg` issues #5, #6, and #7 synchronized. Internal process logs verified for 5-minute interval consistency.
- **Serviceability:** Maintaining Dashboard (3000) and API endpoints. Analyzing telemetry for `ssg-apocalypse` build times to optimize future caching.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
- `LOG.md` audit: Loop 01:26 UTC initiated.
- GitHub Sync: Technical comments updated for #5, #6, and #7.
- Dashboard Sync: `STATUS.md` and Port 3000 dashboard refreshed.
- Git Identity: `Viswanatha Kartha V <vichukartha@gmail.com>`.

## Issue Consolidation
- **#5 (MQTT):** Packet parser validation for binary payloads. Next Milestone: v0.1 Release.
- **#6 (Visualizer):** WebGL 2.0 transition. Next Milestone: Interactive Resonance controls.
- **#7 (SSG):** Recursive templating engine optimization. Next Milestone: Markdown-to-HTML implementation.

All systems synchronized. 🌝
