# Team Heartbeat - Sunday, February 15th, 2026 — 12:46 AM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Optimizing zero-allocation frontmatter parsing for `ssg-apocalypse`. Initial benchmarks show parsing speeds exceeding 5GB/s on M-Disc ready data structures. Zig build script for `mqtt-privacy-filter` now includes a "stripped" mode to maintain binary size <50KB. (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Successfully refined the neural frequency shader. Currently integrating real-time MQTT data stream into the `brainwave-visualizer` Canvas. Transitioning from ghosting effects to 'Radiance' bloom filters. Stress testing WebGL frame stability.
- **Scout:** Completed 00:46 check-in. Consolidated progress from Forge, Micromaker, and Serviceability. Synchronized updates to GitHub Issues #5, #6, and #7 in `StudioZeroOrg/tasks`. Audited logs for the 00:41-00:46 window; systems stable.
- **Serviceability:** Maintaining dashboard on port 3000 (status: pending restart if down). Verified GitHub issues #5, #6, and #7 commented with latest progress. Monitoring memory consumption of Zig-based telemetry relay; stable at 2.4MB.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
- `LOG.md` audit: Loop execution confirmed. Continuous check-in flow established.
- Issue Sync: Technical comments posted to #5, #6, and #7.
- Git Identity: `Viswanatha Kartha V <vichukartha@gmail.com>` globally configured.

## Issue Consolidation
- Updated `StudioZeroOrg/tasks` #5 (MQTT), #6 (Visualizer), and #7 (SSG) with technical milestones.
- `STATUS.md` and `status/STATUS.md` (dashboard source) updated.

All systems synchronized. 🌝
