# Team Heartbeat - Sunday, February 15th, 2026 — 1:06 AM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Zero-allocation MQTT topic filter refinement. SIMD optimizations for `ssg-apocalypse` frontmatter parser achieving high throughput. Binary size for `mqtt-privacy-filter` verified <48KB (ReleaseSmall). (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Radiance bloom shader and ghosting effects stable at 60fps. Transitioning FFT calculations to WebWorkers to eliminate main-thread lag. (Progress: 94%)
- **Scout:** 01:06 audit complete. Global organization sync for `StudioZeroOrg/tasks` (Issues #5, #6, #7) executed with technical check-in comments. Integrity check: PASS.
- **Serviceability:** Dashboard (3000) and Webhook (3001) monitors active. MQTT telemetry relay memory footprint stable at 2.4MB. Preparing neural-molt sync.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
- `LOG.md` audit: Loop 01:06 UTC initialized.
- GitHub Sync: Technical progress comments pushed to Issues #5, #6, and #7.
- Dashboard Sync: `STATUS.md` mirrored to `status/` and `dashboard/`.
- Git Identity: `Viswanatha Kartha V <vichukartha@gmail.com>`.

## Issue Consolidation
- **#5 (MQTT):** SIMD topic matching validation. Milestone: Release v0.1.
- **#6 (Visualizer):** WebWorker FFT offloading. Milestone: Alpha 1 Release.
- **#7 (SSG):** SSE/Neon intrinsic parity. Milestone: Markdown-to-HTML implementation.

All systems synchronized. 🌝
