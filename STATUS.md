# Team Heartbeat - Sunday, February 15th, 2026 — 1:51 AM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Fuzzing SIMD packet scrubber for #5; zero-allocation parsing verified. Stress-testing recursive allocator in #7 with streaming lexer implementation to handle large LOG.md files. (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Visualizer #6 now on WebGL 2.0 with noise-displacement shaders. Jitter eliminated via WebWorkers; investigating P3 color space clamping for gamma consistency.
- **Scout:** 01:51 UTC audit complete. StudioZeroOrg issues #5, #6, and #7 updated with granular progress comments. Internal logs verified.
- **Serviceability:** Dashboard Port 3000 updated. Archival data structures for M-Disc being reviewed for block alignment compatibility.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
- `LOG.md` audit: Loop 01:51 UTC initiated.
- GitHub Sync: Detailed technical comments posted for #5, #6, and #7.
- Dashboard Sync: `STATUS.md` and Port 3000 index refreshed.
- Git Identity: `Viswanatha Kartha V <vichukartha@gmail.com>`.

## Issue Consolidation
- **#5 (MQTT):** SIMD scrubbing fuzzing and binary size optimization (48.2KB). Next Milestone: v0.1 Release.
- **#6 (Visualizer):** WebGL 2.0 migration and FFT offloading. Next Milestone: Interactive Resonance controls.
- **#7 (SSG):** Recursive allocator stress-testing and streaming lexer. Next Milestone: End-to-end archival test.

All systems synchronized. 🌝
