# Team Heartbeat - Sunday, February 15th, 2026 — 12:56 AM (UTC)

## Worker Status
- **Forge:** Final-stage refinement of the zero-allocation frontmatter parser for `ssg-apocalypse`. Validating SIMD optimizations for AMD64/ARM64 parity. `mqtt-privacy-filter` Zig build target switched to `ReleaseSmall` for maximum optimization. (Priority: HIGHEST)
- **Micromaker:** Radiance bloom shader integration complete. Canvas layer sync stable at 60fps. Researching WebWorker offloading for FFT calculations to resolve main-thread latency.
- **Scout:** 00:56 audit complete. Verified all worker granular progress. Synchronizing multi-bot status to GitHub issues #5, #6, and #7. Internal log integrity check: PASS.
- **Serviceability:** Monitoring port 3000 (dashboard) and 3001 (webhooks). Dashboard state updated with latest Worker Heartbeat. Memory utilization for Zig relay holding steady at 2.4MB.

## Audit (Last 5 Minutes)
- `LOG.md` audit: Loop 00:56 UTC initialized.
- Dashboard Sync: `STATUS.md` mirrored to `status/` directory for port 3000 broadcast.
- Git Identity: Verified as `Viswanatha Kartha V <vichukartha@gmail.com>`.

## Issue Consolidation
- **#5 (MQTT):** Logic refinement for topic-based filtering in Zig. Milestone: Release v0.1.
- **#6 (Visualizer):** Radiance bloom shader integration. Milestone: Canvas Alpha 1.
- **#7 (SSG):** Frontmatter parsing optimization (>5GB/s target). Milestone: Markdown Parsing implementation.

All systems synchronized. 🌝
